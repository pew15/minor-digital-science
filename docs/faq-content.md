# Frequently Asked Questions - Modules and Courses

Here are the questions reappearing in students' emails or the information events. 

## What **skills and background** are required for the courses?

All courses are designed for **beginners**, so there are only minimal requirements. 

*   You should have **general computer skills** in using an operating system: basic understanding of a file system (creating/deleting/renaming files and directories), installing programs and learning how to use them. 
*   For programming courses (M1), **basic mathematical skills** are helpful, if you are unsure about your skills you may take a self-test and decide if you want to take an additional course on *Computer Programming Prerequisites* (198812).
*   For advanced modules (M2, M3, M5, see [suggested order](./suggested-order.md), you can find in their descriptions, what skills, background or **prerequisite** courses are expected. In case of questions related to your particular case, you can ask either the DiSC teaching coordinator or teachers of courses you are interested in.

## How many **modules/courses** do I need to take?

You need to take **[5 modules, and 6 courses](https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/teaching/digital-science/)** in the [recommended order](./suggested-order.md). In general, a module consists of one course, the exception is Data Analysis with two courses. 

To address the different interests of students, many courses are offered with [alternative options](). They are meant as exclusive alternatives, where only one course is to be completed. To follow your interest, you can take more alternative courses, but keep in mind that only one will count to the required 30 ECTS credits. Moreover, in the case of multiple bookings for the same module (current and past), your priority in the acceptance procedure will be lower than for students who are taking the module for the first time.

## Which **acceptance rules** are used?

There is [no guarantee to get a place]()) in our courses. Places are filled up from highest to lowest priority groups (see below). In the case of not enough places for a particular group, the randomized assignment is applied within it. Students from all other groups with lower priority will not be assigned to the course. There are the following groups.

1.  High priority: active students of Minor Digital Science. It means students who **completed one or more of our courses**. If needed subgroups are introduced based on the number of completed courses. This rule is used to foster the completion of the whole minor.  
    If there are prerequisite courses for a given course, students who complete them will have the highest priority. This rule is used to have a better learning effect.
2.  Normal priority: **other** students, excluding those in the below groups.
3.  Low priority: students, who already **completed an alternative course** within the module they requested booking to. This criterion is also used to foster the completion of the whole minor by a higher number of students. Formally, only one of the alternative courses is included in the minor. For example, if a student took the course in Programming in Python and now wants to take the course in Programming in R, he/she will be classified here, as only one of the courses will be included in the Introduction to Programming module.
4.  Lowest priority: **PhD students**, as our courses are for BSc and MSc students.

Special cases:

*   Students from **CS programs** [will not get credits]() for courses in modules 1-2 nor in the _Computer Programming Prerequisite_ course, therefore, they will be not accepted in these modules/courses. For other modules/courses, the general rules apply.
*   Additionally, in the case of synergetically offered courses, there is a contingent for students from the minor and the originating study programme. For example, _Digital Business_ is offered with the minor and programs from the Faculty of Business and Management. In this course, the places are split 50:50.
*   For prioritisation, all our courses completed in any of your study programs will be taken into account. You do not need to inform us **if you changed your study program**, e.g. from BSc to MSc.

## When do I **get accepted** for a course?

If there are enough places in a course, you will be accepted within a few days after the end of the registration period.

For the overbooked courses, there is a delay of a few days.

*   At the end of the registration period, we send a call for awareness to all students who requested a booking.** **It is followed by a few days period when students may cancel their booking.
*   Next, we accept students according to their priorities.Students, who are not accepted into the course immediately, get instructions on how to join the course during the trial period in case of vacancies. 

### Why do we need to learn a **programming language**?

In general, it would be possible to use existing tools for data analysis. Probably for most of the common problems, we would find a ready-to-use tool, but we may get stuck if we would need something specific. Programming skills enable us to **customise solutions** to our particular needs.

Moreover, if we learn how to program particular solutions we get a **deeper understanding**. It is like ordering a meal in a restaurant vs. cooking it.

And last not least, programming, once you learn it, is fun! :-)

## Which **programming languages** should we learn?

We offer the most popular languages in Data Science, at the moment there are _**Python**_ and _**R**_.

Therefore, we offer **two courses** **as an alternative** to the _Introduction to Programming_ module, one for _Python_ and one for _R_. There is no ultimate answer on which one to learn. 

*   Each of the languages has particular **strengths**, there are a lot of comparisons on the Internet. In short, _Python_ is a general-purpose programming language, so it is possible to use most of the problems, going beyond data analysis. _R_ is focused on data and is ideal for statistical modelling. The competition between the programming languages forces their developers to extend them, so the possibilities of both programming languages are becoming similar.
*   It is also dependent on the **scientific domain** you are coming from. You can search the Internet for what is popular in your domain (papers, packages, tools), ask our [team](https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/team/) members from your domain, your supervisors or fellow students.
*   There are diverse opinions on which of the languages is **easier to learn**. This is obviously, the same for one person Russian can be easier to learn than Japanese, while for another the other way round. I (Joanna) am teaching both and believe that our R course is slightly easier than our Python course, but in both courses, you will need to work hard to earn the credits.

It was not foreseen to take **both programming courses**, it means if you take both you will get **only one recognised** as the _Introduction to Programming_ module. In practice, many data scientists are using more than one programming language deciding what to use based on a project or even a task. If you wish, you can take both courses, however, we would not recommend taking them in the same semester, as it may be confusing, similar to starting to learn two foreign languages at the same time.
