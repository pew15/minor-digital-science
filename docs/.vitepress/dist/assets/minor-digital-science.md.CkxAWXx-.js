It provides a solid foundation in digitalization relevant to students&#39; disciplines. It conveys the generic skills required for <strong>automated data analysis</strong> and offers a selection of courses on specific <strong>technologies, methods, and aspects</strong> related to students&#39; majors. Finally, it offers the opportunity to conduct a complete data-based decision-making process under the individual supervision of our teachers. To assure high effectiveness of learning, interdisciplinary groups are kept small and vary from 20 to 40 students.</p><p><em>Expected learning outcome</em>: Upon successful completion of the Minor Digital Science, students are capable of applying fundamental methods in the field of digital science. They understand methods and techniques from the fields of programming, data management, and data analysis. They are aware of the broad context of digitalization. They are able to apply techniques of digital science to their field.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Admission</summary><p>The Minor Digital Science can be taken within bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s programs without any restrictions as to students&#39; backgrounds or prior experience. It offers flexibility in content and structure to meet the needs of diverse academic programs. Moreover, the courses are offered mostly at off-peak hours.</p><p>There are two options to take courses:</p><ul><li>as the complete <strong>package</strong> of 30 ECTS credits if a major allows for a minor to be incorporated into the curriculum,</li><li>as individual <strong>courses</strong> (5 ECTS credits each) within the module <em>Non-disciplinary/Interdisciplinary Skills</em> and the module <em>Individual Choice of Specialization</em>.</li></ul><p>It is possible to initially take individual courses and have them accredited later if and when a student&#39;s major allows for the incorporation of minors. Deans of studies may provide information about future integration plans.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Content</summary><p>The Minor Digital Science combines information technology skills and mathematical and statistical knowledge all embedded in the substantive expertise from students&#39; majors.</p><ul><li><strong>Information technology</strong> skills are required to manage data, to automate processes, and to make them replicable.</li><li><strong>Mathematical and statistical</strong> knowledge is necessary to understand and meaningfully apply statistical models and machine learning methods.</li><li>The <strong>substantive expertise</strong> is needed to be able to find sources of data and meaningfully interpret results obtained from the analysis of data.</li></ul><p>The package consists of <strong>five modules</strong> with, in total, six courses of 5 ECTS credits each.
