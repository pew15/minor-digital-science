To follow your interest,Â y****ou can take more alternative courses, but keep in mind that only oneÂ will count to the required 30 ECTS credits.

Places are filled up from highest to lowest priority groups (see below).</strong> In the case of not enough places for a particular group, the randomized assignment is applied within it. Students from all other groups with lower priority will not be assigned to the course. There are the following groups.</p><ol><li>High priority: active students of Minor Digital Science.Â It means students who <strong>completed one or more of our courses</strong>. If needed subgroupsÂ are introduced based on the number of completed courses. This rule is used to foster the completion of the whole minor.<br> If there are prerequisite courses for a given course, students who complete them will have the highest priority. This rule is used to have a better learning effect.</li><li>Normal priority: <strong>other</strong> students, excluding those in the below groups.</li><li><strong>Low priority: students, who already <strong>completed an alternative course</strong> within theÂ moduleÂ they requested booking to. This criterion is also used toÂ foster the completion of the whole minor by a higher number of students. Formally, only one of the alternative courses isÂ included in the minor. For example, if a student tookÂ the course in Programming in Python and now wants to takeÂ the course in Programming in R, he/she will be classified here, as only one of the courses will be includedÂ in the Introduction to Programming module.</strong></li><li><strong>Lowest priority:</strong>Â <strong><strong>PhD students</strong>, as our courses are for BSc and MSc students.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Students from <strong>CS programs</strong> <a href="./.html">will not get credits</a> for courses in modules 1-2 nor in the <em>Computer Programming Prerequisite</em> course, therefore, they will be not accepted in these modules/courses. For other modules/courses, the general rules apply.</strong></li><li><strong>Additionally, in the case of synergetically offered courses, thereÂ isÂ a contingent for students from the minor and the originating study programme. For example,Â <em>Digital Business</em> is offered with the minor and programs from the Faculty of Business and Management. In this course, the places are split 50:50.</strong></li><li><strong>For prioritisation, all our courses completed in any of your study programs will be taken into account. You do not need to inform us <strong>if you changed your study program</strong>, e.g. from BSc to MSc.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="when-do-i-get-accepted-for-a-course" tabindex="-1"><strong>When do I <strong>get accepted</strong> for a course</strong>**?** <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-do-i-get-accepted-for-a-course" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**When do I **get accepted** for a course****?**&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>If there are enough places in a course, you will be accepted within a few days after the end of the registration period.</strong></p><p><strong>For the overbooked courses, there is a delay of a few days.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>At the end of the registration period, we send a call for awareness to all students who requested a booking.</strong> <strong>It is followed by a few days period when students may cancel their booking.</strong></li><li><strong>Next, we accept students according to their priorities.</strong>Â <strong>Students, who are not accepted into the course immediately, get instructions on how to join the course during the trial period in case of vacancies.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="why-do-we-need-to-learn-a-programming-language" tabindex="-1"><strong>Why do we need to learn a <strong>programming language</strong>?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-we-need-to-learn-a-programming-language" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Why do we need to learn a **programming language**?**&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>In general, it would be possible to use existing tools for data analysis. Probably for most of the common problems, we would find a ready-to-use tool, but we may get stuck if we would need something specific. Programming skills enable us to <strong>customiseÂ solutions</strong> to our particular needs.</strong></p><p><strong>Moreover, if we learn how to program particular solutions we get aÂ <strong>deeper understanding</strong>. It is like ordering a meal inÂ a restaurant vs. cooking it.</strong></p><p><strong>And last not least, programming, once you learn it, is fun! ðŸ˜ƒ</strong></p><h3 id="which-programming-languages-should-we-learn" tabindex="-1"><strong>WhichÂ <strong>programming languages</strong>Â should we learn?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#which-programming-languages-should-we-learn" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**WhichÂ **programming languages**Â should we learn?**&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>We offer the most popular languages in Data Science, at the moment there areÂ <em><strong>Python</strong></em> and <em><strong>R</strong></em>.</p><p>Therefore, weÂ offer <strong>two courses</strong> <strong>as an alternative</strong> to the <em>Introduction to Programming</em> module, one for <em>Python</em> and one for <em>R</em>.Â There is noÂ ultimate answer onÂ which oneÂ to learn.</p><ul><li>Each of the languages has particular <strong>strengths</strong>, there are a lot of comparisons on the Internet. In short, <em>Python</em>Â is a general-purpose programming language, so it is possible to use most of the problems, going beyond data analysis. <em>R</em> is focused on data and is ideal for statistical modelling. The competition between the programming languages forces their developers to extend them, so the possibilities of both programming languages are becoming similar.</li><li>It is also dependent on the <strong>scientific domain</strong> you are coming from. You can search the Internet for what is popular in your domain (papers, packages, tools), ask our <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">team</a> members from your domain, your supervisors or fellow students.</li><li>There are diverse opinions on which of the languages is <strong>easier to learn</strong>. This is obviously, the same for one person Russian can be easier to learn than Japanese, while for another the other way round. I (Joanna) am teaching both and believe that our R course is slightly easier than our Python course, but in both courses, you will need to work hard to earn the credits.</li></ul><p>It was not foreseen to take <strong>both programming courses</strong>, it means if you take both you will get <strong>only one recognised</strong> asÂ theÂ <em>Introduction to Programming</em> module. In practice, many data scientists are using more than one programming language deciding what to use based on a project or even a task. If you wish, you can take both courses, however, we would not recommend taking them in the same semester, as it may be confusing, similar to starting to learn two foreign languages at the same time.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-computer-science-and-digital-science" tabindex="-1">What is the difference betweenÂ <strong>Computer Science</strong> andÂ <strong>Digital Science</strong>? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-computer-science-and-digital-science" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the difference betweenÂ **Computer Science** andÂ **Digital Science**?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Please go to <a href="./.html">the comparison table</a>.</p>',28),a=[n];function i(l,u,g,d,h,c){return t(),o("div",null,a)}const f=e(s,[["render",i]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
