If you can study it within your bachelor or master programme and how it will be recognised depends on your major:</p><ul><li><p>If it <strong>explicitly enables the incorporation of minors</strong>, you can take all modules from a minor within your study programme.</p><ul><li>Under successful completion of them all, on your notice (<em>Bescheid</em>) you will get an annotation of completing the minor.</li><li>These <strong>modules</strong> will be listed on your certificate (<em>Zeugnis</em>).</li><li>The single <strong>courses</strong> will be listed on the Diploma Supplement (more precisely on the transcript of records).</li><li>All courses must be allocated in your study in LFU:online, it means as a part of the 180/120 credits.</li></ul></li><li><p>If it includes 30 ECTS credits as “<strong>the window of opportunity</strong>” (the module Interdisciplinary Skills and the module Individual Choice of Specialisation), it is possible to take all the modules from a minor within your study programme.</p><ul><li>The single courses of the minor will be listed on the Diploma Supplement (more precisely on the transcript of records).</li></ul></li><li><p>If it has less than 30 ECTS credits for the module Interdisciplinary Skills and/or the module Individual Choice of Specialisation, it is possible to complete all modules from a minor but you have to gain a higher number of credits than foreseen for your programme.</p><ul><li>In this case, courses completed within the aforementioned modules will be listed on the Diploma Supplement (more precisely on the transcript of records assigned for the study programme) and</li><li>additional courses will be listed on the Diploma Supplement as unassigned <em>(nicht zugeordnet).</em></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="where-can-i-find-information-relevant-to-my-study-programme" tabindex="-1"><strong>Where</strong> can I find information relevant to my study programme? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-can-i-find-information-relevant-to-my-study-programme" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Where** can I find information relevant to my study programme?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This information can be found in the recent/consolidated formal description of your study programme (<strong>C</strong>**<em>urriculum</em>**), where the possibility of completing a minor (<em>Wahlpacket</em>) within the programme should be explicitly stated. For example, <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/ba-wirtschaftswissenschaften/index.html.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bachelor&#39;s Programme Management and Economics</a> (<a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/wirtschaft/bachelor-diplom/wirtschaftswissenschaften/5-1-wirtschaft-plus.html.en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">5+1</a>) and several <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten/philologisch_kulturwissenschaftliche/studium/masterstudien.html.en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">master programmes at the Faculty of Language, Literature and Culture</a> incorporate minors.</p><p>We try to keep track of <a href="./minors-in-list.html">majors allowing minors</a>. However, if it is not clear for your study programme, check your official curricula or ask your (associate) <strong>study deans</strong> who may provide information about future integration plans.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-register-for-a-minor-at-the-inscription-office" tabindex="-1">Do I need to register for a minor at the <strong>inscription office?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-need-to-register-for-a-minor-at-the-inscription-office" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do I need to register for a minor at the **inscription office?**&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>No</strong>, registration for a minor is not required. You can register for particular courses offered in the bundle via LFU:online in September/February (exact periods are provided in the course catalogue before the start of the registration). If a course is offered under different numbers, remember to register for the one starting with <strong>1988</strong>. Under completion of all required courses, if relevant, the completion of the minor will be automatically recognised.</p><h2 id="do-i-have-a-guaranteed-place-in-a-course" tabindex="-1">Do I have a guaranteed <strong>place</strong> in a course? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-have-a-guaranteed-place-in-a-course" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do I have a guaranteed **place** in a course?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For optional courses, there is <strong>no</strong> such guarantee. We plan several parallel groups for generic courses and hope to have enough vacancies for all interested students. In the case of overbooked courses, we will conduct a <a href="./faq-content.html#which-acceptance-rules-are-used">prioritised randomisation acceptance procedure</a>.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-complete-all-courses-in-the-bundle-before-finishing-my-major" tabindex="-1">Do I need to complete all courses in the bundle <strong>before finishing my major</strong>? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-need-to-complete-all-courses-in-the-bundle-before-finishing-my-major" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do I need to complete all courses in the bundle **before finishing my major**?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Yes</strong>, as minors (<em>Wahlpacketen</em>) can only be attended and completed within a study programme. Once you finished your programme, you can not attend/complete any courses of a minor anymore. (Unless you were enrolled in several programmes and only finished one of them.)</p><p>As a reasonable time to complete our minor is <a href="./.html">3 semesters</a>, it is important to <strong>start as early as possible</strong>. It is especially crucial for MSc students.</p><h2 id="can-i-get-a-confirmation-of-completion-of-the-minor" tabindex="-1">Can I get a <strong>confirmation of completion</strong> of the minor? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-get-a-confirmation-of-completion-of-the-minor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I get a **confirmation of completion** of the minor?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Yes</strong>, it is possible to get confirmation.</p><ul><li>In the best case (see the first question-answer item), you will get <strong>annotation</strong> <strong>on your notice</strong> (<em>Bescheid</em>).</li><li>Regardless of the way how you completed our minor, it is also possible to receive a separate <strong>document confirming completion of our minor</strong>.</li><li>You can also generate a <strong>subset of academic records</strong> with our courses and your grades.</li></ul><p>The details are described on a <a href="./confirmation.html">dedicated</a> page.</p><h2 id="can-i-take-courses-from-the-minor-as-a-phd-student" tabindex="-1">Can I take courses from the minor as a <strong>PhD student?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-take-courses-from-the-minor-as-a-phd-student" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I take courses from the minor as a **PhD student?**&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Yes</strong>, you can take them, however, under the following restrictions.</p><ul><li>If the study programme contains the module Scientific Basics / Core Skills of the Thesis Topic (<em>Wissenschaftliche Grundlagen / Kernkompetenzen zum Dissertationsthema</em>) and/or the module Generic Skills (<em>Generische Kompetenzen</em>) the student has to receive the permission of their supervisor to visit courses of the minor as they are not on PhD-level. But even if a study programme (eg. PhD Biology) contains both modules they never add up to more than maximum 20 ECTS credits (e.g. in the PhD Biology both modules add up to 10 ECTS credits, only).</li><li>For the recognition and listing of modules and courses, the same rules as for bachelor and master students apply.</li><li>You will get a place in a course if there are vacancies after accepting bachelor and master students.</li></ul><h2 id="can-i-get-credits-for-programming-courses-as-cs-or-is-student" tabindex="-1">Can I get credits for programming courses as <strong>CS</strong> or <strong>IS student</strong>? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-get-credits-for-programming-courses-as-cs-or-is-student" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I get credits for programming courses as **CS** or **IS student**?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>No</strong>, you can not get credits for them if you study computer science or information systems. Even taking it as an interdisciplinary skill course, you will not get credits for it.
