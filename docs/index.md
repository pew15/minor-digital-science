# Teaching


The teaching portfolio of DiSC is available to all students of the University of Innsbruck. We offer the Minor Digital Science and are involved in other teaching-related initiatives.

The Minor Digital Science is a bundle of courses designed to provide a solid foundation of digitalization.
