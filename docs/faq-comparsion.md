### What is the difference between **Computer Science** and **Digital Science**?

There are two kinds of differences between [Supplementary Program **Computer Science**](https://www.uibk.ac.at/studium/angebot/es-informatik/index.html.en) (SP-CS) and [Minor **Digital Science**](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/disc/teaching/minor-digital-science/) (M-DS): related to the formal regulations and related to the content ([in German](https://www.uibk.ac.at/informatik/studium/vergleich-ewsi-und-edisc.html)).

data science, e.g. Python or R 

15 ECTS credits in data-related modules: algorithms and data structures, database systems 

**data**

20 ECTS credits in data-focused modules: data management, data analysis courses and project

7.5 ECTS credits elective courses from the bachelor’s program computer science

**elective  
courses**

Computer Scientists / Department of Computer Science

**teaching staff**

Interdisciplinary / Digital Science Center

The SP is a subset of basic courses of the bachelor’s program in computer science. It is possible to transfer eligible credits from and to this program.

**crediting**

depending on the curricula: as minor or as elective modules, especially as interdisciplinary and generic skills
